--Assignment Operator--

lhs = rhs

.Right-hand side (rhs) is an expression that is evaluated to a value
.The value of the rhs is stored to the lhs
.The value of the rhs must be type compatible with the lhs
.The lhs must be assignable
.Assignment expression is evaluated to what was just assigned
.More than one variable can be assigned in a single statement

C++ Arithmetic Operators

+ addition | - subtraction | * multiplication | / division | % modulo 

.modulo or remainder only works with integers
.+,-,*,/ operators are overloaded to work with multiple types such as int, double, etc.

Increment / Decrement Operators

Increment operator: ++
Decrement operator: --

.Increases or decreases its operand by 1
.Can be used with integers, floating point types and pointers

Prefix: ++num
Postfix: num++

.Don't overuse this operator and never use it twice for the same variable within
the same statement.
